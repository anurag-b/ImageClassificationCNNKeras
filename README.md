# ImageClassificationCNNKeras
Convolutional Neural Network tutorial for Image Classification using CIFAR10 dataset and Keras with tensorflow backend.

In this repo, you can see how to implement a Convolutional Neural Network in Keras. We will use CIFAR10 classification as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of a CNN. We will also see how to spot and overcome Overfitting during training using data augmentation.
